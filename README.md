https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/introduction-to-ray-tracing/how-does-it-work

Read through and learned how ray tracing works, then created the ray tracer with this guide as reference

## Purpose
Improve my C++ abilities and learn more about computer graphics.

## To Run
Use commands: 
- c++ -o raytracer -O3 -Wall raytracer.cpp
- raytracer > raytracer.ppm

This creates a ppm file with the result, open using gimp
